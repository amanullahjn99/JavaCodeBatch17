String Class:
    String class is designed to store symbols(letters(A,B,C), numbers(10,25), special characters(#$%))
    in the form of group. There are many methods already written by java developers that we can just use.
    For Example:
    length()
    startsWith()
    endsWith()
    contain()
Why we sould learn about this class?
    1)Very important for coding questions.
    2)Most widely used class in all java.
    3)MOst of the information in real life is present in the form of Strings.

Method Chaining:
    When multiple methods are being called on the same line its called method chaining.
    String class supports methods changing. for method chanining to work previois method must return the
    the expected datatype for the next method.

       System.out.println(str.toLowerCase().trim().replace("great", "Good"));
         System.out.println(str.toLowerCase().isEmpty().replace("great", "Good"));

Note:
    Very important for coding questions.
    1)If else
    2)Loops
