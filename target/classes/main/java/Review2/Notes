Type Casting:
    Type casting is converting data from one data type to another datatype.
    for example we can convert an integer to float or other way around.
    there are two type of type casting. The casting only work primitive(char, int,double...) data types
    1)Implicit/Auto type/Widening
    2)Explicit/Manual/narrow
Example:
    int number=(int)10.5
 ========================================================
 If statements
    If statements are part of the conditional constructs in java.
    They help us write code that can be executed based on a condition.
    There are many variation of if statements 1)if 2)if-else  3)else-if  4)Nested if

 Why we need conditional statements?
    without the if statements programs will alsways generate same outputs not matter what.
 Syntax:
    If(Condition){
    something that we want to execute if conditon is ture
    }else{
    something that we want to execute if condition is false
    }
 Note:
1) Whenever it is possible to write code with else-if and multiple if conditions
 always go with else-if statements.
 2)with primitive datatype we can use><== ! =etc.
 but with not primitive we have to use the equals method.
