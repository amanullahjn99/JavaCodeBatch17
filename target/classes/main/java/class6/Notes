Operators:
    Operators are symbol which perform an operation on data. there are many different  types of operators in java.
Arithmetic Operators:
    These operators help us perform simple mathematical operation like
    Addition        => +    int a=10 int b=20 int c=a+b; =>30
    Subtraction     => -
    Multiplication  => *
    Division        => /
    Modulus         => %
Shorthand Operators:
    They helpus perform Mathematical operations but using a little shorter syntax.
    add and update the variable += int a =10 a+=20  =>30
    subtract and update the varible -= int a=10 a-=20   =>-10
    Multiply and update the varible *= int a=10 a*=20   =>200
    divide and update the varible /= int a=10 a/=20   =>0
    Modulus and update the varible %= int a=10 a%=20   =>200 ???

Relational Operators:
    These operators help us compare thing.
    ==check is two objects are equal
    != checks if two objects are Not equal.
    > Great than
    < Less than
    >= greater than equal
    <= less than equal

Logical Operators:
    They help us combine multiple boolean conditions
    ! NOT
    || OR
    && AND

Increment/Decrement operators:
    ++  this will help us increase the value of a variable by one
    __  this will help us decrease the value of a variable by one

Note:
'While' loop checks the condition first then executes the code . 'do while' on the other hand executes
the code first and then check the condition. Sometimes when we write the logic using 'do while' it
become easier. There are no other differences and reasons to use a 'do while' instead of 'while'.
