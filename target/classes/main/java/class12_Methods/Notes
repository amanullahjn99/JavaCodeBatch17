Methods/Functions/Behaviours/Routines
    methods are blocks of code that contains pre-written code that is executed.
    when we call a methods.
There are two main types of methods:
    1) Methods which do not return any data (void type)
    2) Methods which can return data like int double char etc..
Syntax:
datatype methodName(dataType nameOfPerameter,datatype NameOfOtherParam){
this is where we wirte the logic

return the results if the method type is not void
}
int add (int num1, int num2){
        int result=num1+num2;
        return result;
    }
int=> return type of method
add=> name of the method
(int num1, int num2) => parameters
    {           => Body of the method
        int result=num1+num2;

        return result;
        }
