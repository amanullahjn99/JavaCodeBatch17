Logical Operators:
    Logical operators help combine multible condition on the same line in if statement.
    There are three types of  logical operators NOT(!), OR (||), AND(&).
NOT(!):
    true=>false
    false=>true
Why should we use NOT operator:
    1) it an help us simplify the logic in some of the cases
    2)Code readablity will in increase.

OR(||):
    Logical OR operator will help us combine multiple condition in such a way that as soon as one condition
     gets true the whole condition will be evaluated to true.

true ||false||ture=>true
false||false ||false=>false
true || true ||true=>true

AND(%%)
    Logical and operator will help us combine the condition in such a way
    that it will only give us true if all the condition are true.
 true && false && ture=>false
 ture && true && ture=>true
 true && true && false=>false
