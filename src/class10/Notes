Object oriented Programming:
    Its just a way(Set of rules) of writing code
    It basically helps us write large amount of code. That is easier to change and manage. There are other
    like functional programming and procedural programming.
Why we should use OOP(Object Oriented Programming):
    1) It helps us write large amount of code easily.
    2) It also helps us represent the world around us inside computers easily.
    3) Changing code become easier.
    4) Sharing code and collaboration becomes easier.
Main concept/Main Pillars of OOP:
    1) Classes and objects  (Base not considered main pillar)
    2) Inheritance
    3) Polymorphism
    4) Abstraction
    5) Encapsulation

Classes and objects:
    A Class is like a map/blueprint/idea/design that we create before we start
    building the actual object. Classes have properties/attributes which help us figure out how
    something looks like and they have behaviours/functions which helps us understand how something works.
