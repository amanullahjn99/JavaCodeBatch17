Arrays:
    Arrays are datastructures that help us store large amounts of similar data.
    Arrays use indexing to manipulate data inside them. Indexs always start from zero.
Why should we use arrays?
    Arrays help us store and manipulate large amounts of data easily with the help of loops. Whenever we have more
    than 3 similar items that we can to store and process together we should always go with arrays.
Syntax:
    There are two ways of creating the arrays.
    Method1:
    Datatype[] nameOfTheArrays={element1, element2, element3};
    Method2:
    DataType[] nameOfTheArrays= new DataTypes[Size];
Enhanced for Loop:
    Enhanced for loop is used to iterate through datastructures which have
    multiple items stored inside them.
Why should we use Enhanced for loop:
    Its simple and easy to understand.
Syntax:
    for(DataTypeOfElement anuVariableNames:NameOfTheDataStructure){
    }
Limitations of Enhanced For Loop:
    1)Enhanced for loop cant be used for updating th elements.
    2) Access the elements in the reverse order etc.
