Loop:
    when to use loops - when we want to repeat a block of code
     when we do not know the exact number of iterations - while or do while
     when we know how many times we want to repeat or iterate the code - for loop or enhanced for loop
     we use enhanced for loop ONLY with arrays or collections
 Enhence Loop:
    enhanced for/ for each loop/ advanced for --- loop syntax
     for(DataTypeofElement anyVariableName:NameofTheDataStructure){


Array:
    When we do not know the exact number of iterations we use while or do While
    When we know how many times we want to reapet


    we use enhanced for loop only
